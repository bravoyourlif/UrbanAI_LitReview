## Abstract
With the increasing prevalence of AI in urban studies, there is a growing demand to examine and leverage its wide-ranging applications. This study utilizes a bibliometric analysis, employing LDA topic modeling and a systematic literature review, to identify nine major research topics within urban studies and explore how AI is utilized in each area. Through this systematic review, some potential pathways for applying AI in urban studies research are discussed and concerns regarding the applicability of AI in urban research are highlighted. Finally, the study proposes the adoption of Causal/Explainable AI as potential solutions to mitigate the concerns.
